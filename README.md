# Pokémon Stalker

*Gets basic info about Pokémon because why not*

## What it does:
Connects to PokéAPI and prints ID, name, type, height, and weight.

## How to use:
1. Install `requests`
2. Run it
3. Learn that Ditto weighs 40... something

## Current target: 
**Ditto** - ID 132, normal type, height 3, weight 40. A pink blob that should auto transform and NOT HAVE IT AS ITS FIRST MOVE.

Change `pokemon_name = "ditto"` to check other Pokémon.

*No Ditto were harmed. They just got confused.*
